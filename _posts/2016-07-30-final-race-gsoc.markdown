It's been a while since I wrote a post here. A lot has happened since then.
Now Gnome-games fully supports PlayStation games, with snapshoting capabilities.
The next thing I'm working on is multi-disc support, specially for PlayStation titles.
So far, there's a working propotity although a lot needs to be re-engineered and polished.
This last part of the project has involved working both in UI, persistance and logic layers.

With more than 35 files (and counting..) edited, I'm on track to finish GSoC before the
deadline! I'm very excited to show the final product in my next post. Stay tunned!

Here's a sneak peak of what I'm working on ;)
