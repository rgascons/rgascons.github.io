Hello fellow friends and programmers, alike. Welcome to my new blog!
For quite some time I've wanted to write my own blog-posts and share
my thoughts as a person and as a programmer.

For those who may not know me yet, here's a quick introduction.

I was born and raised in Barcelona, and I live here still today. Currently,
I'm in my third year of Computer Science, enjoying my way to become a 
graduate throw numerous Hackathons, travels and a few personal projects.

This summer I'll be working with the GNOME organisation thanks to
Google's Summer of Code program. This blog will serve as a way for me
to tell my advancements through the whole program.

I plan to post at least once a month, I'm sure you will enjoy reading 
my entries as much as I do writing them.
