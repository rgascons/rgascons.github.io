Hello everyone,  as I stated in the opening post, I am participating in
Google Summer of Code 2016 under the GNOME Organisation.

My project is related to GNOME Games mostly written by [Kekun](https://github.com/Kekun), a brand new application that serves
as a catalog of games alongside a bunch of emulators. My proposal aims
to port more game systems and platforms, such as PlayStation 1, GoG games
and offer support to features like multi-disk support.

Here's how the App currently looks like:

Wonderful right!?

I won't be the only one collaborating in GNOME Games though, my fellow
programming mate [meghprkh](https://meghprkh.github.io/blog/2016/05/23/GSoC-2016-Introduction/)
will be working on including the ability to control games using a gamepad,
among other things.

It looks like this summer will be awesome!
